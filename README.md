# The Collatz conjecture (or most dangerous math problem)
The Collatz conjecture, proposed by mathematician Lothar Collatz in 1937, is a deceptively simple yet unsolved problem in number theory. Starting with any positive integer n, follow these rules iteratively:
- If n is even, divide it by 2.
- If n is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1.
This process continues until n reaches 1. The conjecture suggests that regardless of the initial value of n, the sequence will always reach 1. Despite extensive computational verification, a rigorous proof remains elusive, making it a captivating challenge in mathematics. This project visualizes the Collatz conjecture, providing insights into its behavior and patterns.
